# Online Ger Camp Rental and Booking Platform

Diploma project: Online platform to browse, check availability and book traditional Mongolian gers (yurts).

This repository contains a starter scaffold for a MERN stack application: backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) and a frontend placeholder for React.

See backend/README.md and frontend/README.md for setup instructions.

Backend: run `npm install` inside backend and set environment variables using backend/.env.example. Start with `npm run dev` after installing nodemon globally or as devDependency.

This scaffold includes basic models, auth, ger and booking routes.
